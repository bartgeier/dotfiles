# ssh Key and Github â€“ repository

A simple solution is to associate an ssh key with the user so that the user
has acces to all repos (in the github profile). In the .ssh directory there is
no config which means no redirection and therefore it uses the standard id_rsa and
id_rsa.pub files.

A second solution is to give the user one key to access only one repo. 
Every repo has its own keys.

This document describes the second solution.
If you go with the second solution the simple solution is not possible
anymore. So you have to make a decision. As an example I will use my Linux 
dotfiles project on a Windows computer.

On my Linux computer I use a git bare repository to manage my dotfiles.

This document is intended as a cheat sheet for myself.
Because this stuff is really confusing. ðŸ˜‰

# SSH Key

Use powershell and go into your .ssh directory.
PS C:\> cd C:\Users\xxx\\.ssh

## Generate key

https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
```
PS C:\Users\xxx> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\xxx/.ssh/id_ed25519): C:\Users\xxx\.ssh\id_rsa_dotfiles
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\xxx\.ssh\id_rsa_dotfiles.
Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\xxx\.ssh\id_rsa_dotfiles.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:AFh5k3QSiJh4Y/+pSIoJ6wNsuSqdRDYJZUrULhkpM0E your_email@example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|=E=+o++o.        |
|X=*.o.+o         |
|o*++ ...         |
| o=..  .         |
|.oo. . .S        |
|o+o   o          |
|=B.o .           |
|*o+ .            |
|=..              |
+----[SHA256]-----+
PS C:\Users\xxx>
```
Two Files are created:  
private key: id_rsa_dotfiles  
public key:  id_rsa_dotfiles.pub  

Never ever save the key files in your repo. ðŸ˜±

## Deploy key on your Github repo

Copy the content of the public Key "id_rsa_dotfiles.pub" into your Github repo.

## Add a redirection to the config file

If config file doesn't exist create it.
Then add Host dotfiles.github.com.

config file:
```
Host 3D_Viewer.github.com
  HostName github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile C:/Users/xxx/.ssh/id_rsa_Bartgeier
Host Show_3d.github.com
  HostName github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile C:/Users/xxx/.ssh/id_rsa
Host BLE1.github.com
  HostName github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile C:/Users/xxx/.ssh/id_rsa_BLE1
Host dotfiles.github.com
  HostName github.com
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile C:/Users/xxx/.ssh/id_rsa_dotfiles
```
The config file does the magic.  
If we communicate with git to gitHub: push, pull, etc. 
**Then the config file does a redirection:**  
git@dotfiles.github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git  
becomes:  
git@github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git

# Rename url in your git project

Go to the dotfiles project directory.  
This renaming is necessary to get the redirection to work.
```
PS C:\Projekts\Linux\dotfiles> git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git (push)
PS C:\Projekts\Linux\dotfiles> git remote set-url origin git@dotfiles.github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git
PS C:\Projekts\Linux\dotfiles> git remote -v
origin  git@dotfiles.github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git (fetch)
origin  git@dotfiles.github.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git (push)
PS C:\Projekts\Linux\dotfiles> git push
Everything up-to-date
PS C:\Projekts\Linux\dotfiles>
```
Or if your repo does not exist yet, create it:

git init  
git remote add origin git@dotfiles.gihub.com:bartgeier/dotfiles.git  
git pull origin master
